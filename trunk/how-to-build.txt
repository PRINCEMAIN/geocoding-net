In order to compile the solution in Visual Studio, you must first
run the build in MSBuild. The build process generates some files that
are needed to compile in Visual Studio.

The easiest way to run the build is just to run build-quick.bat. This will
run a basic Debug build without running any tests.


NOTE: If you don't have VisualSVN installed (or if you have it installed on a 32-bit system),
you will need to change the path to svnversion.exe in order to successfully run the build.
See sample build commands below for example.


How to Build from Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt
==============================================================
Here are some sample build commands (these should be run from the src directory):

Debug Build with tests
  > msbuild geocoding.build

Debug Build without tests (only version + compile)
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Version;Compile

Debug Build without tests and custom path to svnversion.exe
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Version;Compile /p:svnToolPath=C:\Program Files\Subversion

Release Build
  > msbuild geocoding.build /p:Configuration=Release

Zip Debug Build to Output Dir (no tests)
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Zip

Generate AssemblyInfoCommon file
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Version


Service tests
==============
You will need to generate API keys for each respective service to run the service tests.
Edit App.config in Services.Tests and put in your API keys.
