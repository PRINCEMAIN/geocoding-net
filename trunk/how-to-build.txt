NOTE: In order to compile the solution in Visual Studio, you must first
run the build in MSBuild. The build process generates some files that
are needed to compile in Visual Studio.

NOTE: If you don't have VisualSVN installed, you will need to change
the path to svnversion.exe in order to successfully run the build. Create a copy
of settingsOverride.build.temp and and rename it to settingsOverride.build and replace
the svnToolPath with your custom path to svnversion.exe.

Debug Build without tests (only version + compile)
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Version;Compile
  
Release Build
  > msbuild geocoding.build /p:Configuration=Release

Zip Debug Build to Output Dir (no tests)
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Zip
  
Generate AssemblyInfoCommon file
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Version

You will need to generate API keys for each respective service to run the service tests.
Edit App.config in Services.Tests and put in your API keys.
