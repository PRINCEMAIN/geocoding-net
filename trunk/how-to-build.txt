NOTE: In order to compile the solution in Visual Studio, you must first
run the build in MSBuild. The build process generates some files that
are needed to compile in Visual Studio.

NOTE: If you don't have VisualSVN installed, you will need to change
the path to svnversion.exe in order to successfully run the build. Create a copy
of settingsOverride.build.temp and and rename it to settingsOverride.build and replace
the svnToolPath with your custom path to svnversion.exe.


Build using MSBuild (either 3.5 or 2.0 version should work).
For basic Debug build, just run build.bat.
