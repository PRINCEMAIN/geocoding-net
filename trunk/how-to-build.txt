NOTE: In order to compile the solution in Visual Studio, you must first
run the build in MSBuild. The build process generates some files that
are needed to compile in Visual Studio.

NOTE: If you don't have VisualSVN installed (or if you have it installed on a 32-bit system),
you will need to change the path to svnversion.exe in order to successfully run the build.
See sample build commands below for example.

Build geocoding.build using MSBuild. For basic Debug build without running tests, just run build-quick.bat.


How to Build from Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt
==============================================================
Here are some sample build commands (these should be run from the src directory):

Debug Build with tests
  > msbuild geocoding.build

Debug Build with tests and custom path to svnversion.exe
  > msbuild geocoding.build /p:svnToolPath=C:\Program Files\Subversion

Debug Build without tests (only version + compile)
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Version;Compile
  
Release Build
  > msbuild geocoding.build /p:Configuration=Release

Zip Debug Build to Output Dir (no tests)
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Zip
  
Generate AssemblyInfoCommon file
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Version


Service tests
==============
You will need to generate API keys for each respective service to run the service tests.
Edit App.config in Services.Tests and put in your API keys.
