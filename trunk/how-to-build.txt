Build using MSBuild (either 3.5 or 2.0 version should work).

For basic Debug build, just run build.bat.

How to Build from Visual Studio 2008 (or 2005) Command Prompt
==============================================================
Here are some sample build commands:

Debug Build
  > msbuild geocoding.build
  
Release Build
  > msbuild geocoding.build /p:Configuration=Release

Zip Debug Build to Output Dir (no tests)
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Zip
  
Generate AssemblyInfoCommon file
  > msbuild geocoding.build /t:Version



Service tests
==============
You will need to generate API keys for each respective service to run the service tests.
Make a copy of App.config.temp and rename it to App.Config in Services.Tests folder
and put in your API keys.
